# This challenge:  
This challenge is much simpler than the previous.  You are provided with a bare bones implementation of "Conway's Game of Life".  The goal here is to implement user interaction with the simulation.  


### Primary goal:  
Currently the only interactivity is pressing spacebar to pause and resume the simulation.  The primary aim is to allow the user to add cells with the left mouse button and remove cells with the right mouse button.  There should also be a way for the player to clear/reset the simulation.


### Take it as far as you like:
Features to consider implementing include changing the simulation rules; adding zooming/scrolling; adding color change for cells as they "age"; loading other well known life patterns; and simulation speed controls.


### Suggestions:  
If you are unfamiliar with "Conway's Game of Life", consider reading the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  For all the information you could ever possibly want, see the [life wiki](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page).  

For an example of some of the types of features you can implement, you could check out one of my old projects:

The code is horrendous, so I highly advise you don't look at it (please), but the implementation is quite complete and should give you some ideas on how far this can be taken.


### Notes:  
As always, feel free to ignore as much of my code as you like and implement everything yourself if you so desire.
